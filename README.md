# markov-chain-text-generator

This python program let's the user input any text and expect an output in the form of markov chain text generated by the
program based on the number of words the user wants returned.

Every text file must first be converted into a dictionary so it can be used.
For converting a text file into a dictionary, use the following command:

**create_dictionary(filename)**



Finally, to get automatically generated text, type in the following command:

**generate_text(word_dict, num_words)**

where **word_dict** is the dictionary created in the previous step, and **num_words** is the number of words the user
wants to get as output, based on the input text file.
